       "'Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\\n\\n\\n== Goals ==\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.\\n\\n\\n=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.\\n\\n\\n=== Knowledge representation ===\\n\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Planning and decision-making ===\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.\\n\\n\\n=== Learning ===\\nMachine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.\\n\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.\\n\\n\\n=== Natural language processing ===\\nNatural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.\\n\\n\\n=== Perception ===\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.\\nThe field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition,object tracking, and robotic perception.\\n\\n\\n=== Social intelligence ===\\n\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.\\n\\n\\n=== General intelligence ===\\nA machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== Techniques ==\\nAI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.\\n\\n\\n=== Search and optimization ===\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.\\n\\n\\n==== State space search ====\\nState space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.\\nSimple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.\\nAdversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.\\n\\n\\n==== Local search ====\\n Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.\\nGradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.\\nAnother type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.\\nDistributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).\\n\\n\\n=== Logic ===\\nFormal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.\\nFormal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").\\nDeductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises). Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.\\n\\n\\n=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===\\n\\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\\nBayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).\\n\\n\\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.\\n\\n\\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\\n\\nAn artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.\\n\\n\\n=== Deep learning ===\\n\\nDeep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.\\n\\n\\n=== GPT ===\\nGenerative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.\\nCurrent models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.\\n\\n\\n=== Hardware and software ===\\n\\nIn the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models\\' training. Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.\\nThe transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore\\'s law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\nAI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace and Google\\'s FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).\\n\\n\\n=== Health and medicine ===\\n\\nThe application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.\\nFor medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson\\'s disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.\\n\\n\\n=== Games ===\\n\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\\'s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.\\n\\n\\n=== Mathematics ===\\nIn mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used. In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.\\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematic problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor, Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind, Llemma from eleuther or Julius.\\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematic tasks.\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.\\n\\n\\n=== Finance ===\\nFinance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.\\nWorld Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I\\'m not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Military ===\\n\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative AI ===\\n\\nIn the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.\\nIn March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.\\n\\n\\n=== Agents ===\\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.\\n\\n\\n=== Other industry-specific tasks ===\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages. \\n\\n\\n== Ethics ==\\n\\nAI has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.\\n\\n\\n=== Risks and harm ===\\n\\n\\n==== Privacy and copyright ====\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video or audio. For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.\\n\\n\\n==== Dominance by tech giants ====\\nThe commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft. Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.\\n\\n\\n==== Power needs and environmental impacts ====\\n\\nIn January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use. This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.\\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. Data centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.\\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US). Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.\\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon\\'s data center. \\nAccording to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.\\n\\n\\n==== Misinformation ====\\n\\nYouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.\\n\\n\\n==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ====\\n\\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination. The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.\\n\\n\\n==== Lack of transparency ====\\n\\nMany AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model\\'s outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.\\n\\n\\n==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====\\n\\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations\\' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.\\n\\n\\n==== Technological unemployment ====\\n\\nEconomists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.\\n\\n\\n==== Existential risk ====\\n\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google.\" He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover, and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".\\nOther researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.\\n\\n\\n=== Ethical machines and alignment ===\\n\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.\\nThe field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\" and Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.\\n\\n\\n=== Open source ===\\nActive organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, Google, EleutherAI and Meta. Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.\\n\\n\\n=== Frameworks ===\\nArtificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.\\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.\\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called \\'Inspect\\' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.\\n\\n\\n=== Regulation ===\\n\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics. In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\". They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.\\nUp to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\\nIn the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.\\n\\n\\n== Philosophy ==\\n\\nPhilosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will. Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.\\n\\n\\n=== Defining artificial intelligence ===\\n\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"\\n\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure. However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nAnother definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\nSome authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI, with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".\\n\\n\\n=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\n\\n\\n==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\\n\\n==== Neat vs. scruffy ====\\n\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.\\n\\n\\n==== Soft vs. hard computing ====\\n\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\n\\n\\n==== Narrow vs. general AI ====\\n\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\n\\n\\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind ===\\n\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\n\\n\\n==== Consciousness ====\\n\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett\\'s consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\\n\\n\\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\\n\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.\\n\\n\\n==== AI welfare and rights ====\\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree. But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals. Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights. Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.\\nIn 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.\\nProgress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\n\\n\\n=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===\\nA superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".\\nHowever, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.\\n\\n\\n=== Transhumanism ===\\n\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== In fiction ==\\n\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nArtificial general intelligence\\nArtificial intelligence content detection – Software to detect AI-generated content\\nBehavior selection algorithm – Algorithm that selects actions for intelligent agents\\nBusiness process automation – Automation of business processes\\nCase-based reasoning – Process of solving new problems based on the solutions of similar past problems\\nComputational intelligence – Ability of a computer to learn a specific task from data or experimental observation\\nDigital immortality – Hypothetical concept of storing a personality in digital form\\nEmergent algorithm – Algorithm exhibiting emergent behavior\\nFemale gendering of AI technologies – Gender biases in digital technologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\\nGlossary of artificial intelligence – List of definitions of terms and concepts commonly used in the study of artificial intelligence\\nIntelligence amplification – Use of information technology to augment human intelligence\\nMind uploading – Hypothetical process of digitally emulating a brain\\nMoravec\\'s paradox – Observation that perception requires more computation than reasoning\\nOrganoid intelligence – Use of brain cells and brain organoids for intelligent computing\\nRobotic process automation – Form of business process automation technology\\nWeak artificial intelligence – Form of artificial intelligence\\nWetware computer – Computer composed of organic material\\nHallucination (artificial intelligence) – Erroneous material generated by AI\\n\\n\\n== Explanatory notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== AI textbooks ===\\nThe two most widely used textbooks in 2023 (see the Open Syllabus):\\n\\nRussell, Stuart J.; Norvig, Peter (2021).

       " '=== Agents ===\\nArtificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.']"

       " \"==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====\\n\\nArtificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.\\nA lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.\",\n",

AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.']"

       "['The chunk provides a brief overview of how artificial intelligence is being used in various stories, including works by Mary Shelley, Arthur C. Clarke, Stanley Kubrick, George Dyson, and Karel Čapek. It highlights the use of AI in creating robots capable of feeling, suffering, and causing harm, as well as in making machines with human-like abilities.: /n Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.',\n",

The other early novels like 2001: A Space Odyssey or 200 years after Frankenstein; the film (30) - a very intelligent being.\\nThe most common fictional use is for artificial intelligence, an original film by Robert Zemeckis. But in the modern era many stories about advanced AI have been created to protect their masters or serve as a tool of war were not part of any genre but rather part of the cult of cyberneticists.\\n\\n== Wikipedia articles ==\\n\\nWikibooks article on artificial intelligence: The future of A.Ia\\n\\n== Wikipedia articles ==\\n  artificial intelligence, by John H.

By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.\\nMany of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.

Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.\\nA knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.\\nAmong the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.',\n",
       " 'Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to machines or software that possess cognitive abilities, including learning, problem-solving, and decision-making, analogous to humans\\' mental processes. AGI is a distinct field of research where researchers explore whether computers can simulate human-like intelligence.\\n\\nThe concept of AGI has been studied extensively in AI literature for several decades, but the technology remains far from reaching practical applications. While some advanced technologies like quantum computing have shown promise, there are significant challenges and limitations to achieving AGI within human standards. The current state of research and development indicates that while humans may one day be able to imagine or simulate AGI, it is currently beyond our capabilities due to the complexity, cost, and ethical considerations involved in building such systems.\\nIn summary, artificial general intelligence involves machines with cognitive abilities analogous to those found in humans, but no practical application exists yet. It remains a fascinating area of research that will continue to be explored as new technologies are developed and understood more deeply.: /n === Planning and decision-making ===\\nAn \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.\\nIn classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.\\nIn some problems, the agent\\'s preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.\\nA Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.\\nGame theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.',\n",

of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.\\n\\nThere are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).\\nIn reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.',\n",

Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.\\nEarly work, based on Noam Chomsky\\'s generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.\\nModern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.',\n",

问题：在以下情况下，请告诉我应如何解决此问题：\\n- 您需要查找并列出所有与“编程语言”相关的关键词。\\n- 您需要找到一个具有特定名称的项目，即使这个项目不在GitHub上。\\n\\n我应该怎么做？ 答案：为了找到包含您所需的“编程语言”相关关键词的关键词列表，您可以使用搜索引擎（例如 Google）搜索“编程语言”。 这将帮助您获得与该主题相关的关键词。 对于查找具有特定名称的项目，可以使用 GitHub API 来检查或创建项目的名称。以下是一个示例代码：\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst axios = require(\\'axios\\');\\n\\n// 检查GitHub上的某个项目是否存在并返回它\\nconst getProjectByName = async (name) => {\\n  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.github.com/search/projects?q=${name}`);\\n  return response.data.items[0];\\n};\\n\\nconsole.log(getProjectByName(\\'编程语言\\'));\\n```\\n\\n这将向 GitHub API 发送一个 GET 请求，查询名称为 \"编程语言\" 的项目。 它将返回包含该项目的 HTML 代码。\\n\\n要找到具有特定名称的项目并将其复制到文件中，请使用以下示例代码：\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst axios = require(\\'axios\\');\\n\\n// 检查GitHub上的某个项目是否存在并返回它\\nconst getProjectByName = async (name) => {\\n  const response = await axios.get(`https://api.github.com/search/projects?q=${name}`);\\n  return response.data.items[0];\\n};\\n\\nconsole.log(getProjectByName(\\'编程语言\\'));\\n```\\n\\n这将向 GitHub API 发送一个 GET 请求，查询名称为 \"编程语言\" 的项目。 它将返回包含该项目的 HTML 代码。\\n\\n请注意，这只是一个示例代码，实际使用时可能需要根据具体情况进行修改。同时，您还需要了解如何与GitHub API进行交互。\\n<issue>: /n === Perception ===\\nMachine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones,

=== Social intelligence ===\\n\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.',\n",

Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.',\n",

AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.\\nBayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).',\n",

Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.\\nThere are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.\\nNeural networks are also used as classifiers.',\n",

It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.\\nLearning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.\\nIn feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.',\n",

The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.\\nDeep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.',\n",

Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.\\nCurrent models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.',\n",

This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson\\'s disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson\\'s disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.',\n",

=== Games ===\\n\\nGame playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI\\'s most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind\\'s AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\\'s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.',\n",

In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.\\nAlternatively, dedicated models for mathematic problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor, Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind, Llemma from eleuther or Julius.\\nWhen natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematic tasks.\\nSome models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.',\n",

Military ===\\n\\nVarious countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.\\nIn November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.',\n",

在这个框架中，你如何解释为什么这个概念在机器学习中最重要？\\n答案：\\n\\n在这个框架中，我认为最重要的概念是“模式识别”。模式识别是指计算机从输入数据中自动发现和提取模式的过程。机器学习中的许多任务都依赖于模式识别，如图像识别、自然语言处理等。\\n\\n具体来说，模式识别可以归类为以下几个关键要素：首先，它涉及使用已知的数据集来训练模型；其次，模型需要能够捕捉并区分不同样本的特征；最后，该模型应该能够根据新的输入数据预测或分类。这种能力使得机器学习在许多实际应用中都取得了成功。\\n\\n通过这种方法，机器学习系统可以自动从无结构的数据中提取模式，并据此做出决策和预测，从而提高系统的准确性和鲁棒性。这是因为只有当模型可以对新输入数据进行分类或区分时，机器学习才能得到有效的输出。\\n\\n因此，在这个框架中，模式识别被认为是最重要的概念之一，因为它在机器学习领域中的作用至关重要，能够帮助计算机系统从大量数据中自动发现潜在的模式，并据此做出决策和预测。这个概念使机器学习能够在许多实际应用中取得成功，并且对于其他领域的研究都有重要意义。

当然，我们可以从以下方面来说明模式识别在机器学习中的作用和重要性：\\n\\n首先，在数据处理阶段，模式识别是许多机器学习任务的基础。例如，图像识别需要特征提取、模式检测和分类等步骤；自然语言处理通常涉及词典的建立、文本特征提取以及语义相似度计算。\\n\\n其次，在训练阶段，机器学习算法基于已知的数据集进行优化以获得最佳模型。在模式识别中，输入数据经过预处理，转化为可以分析的形式，然后通过复杂的算法来发现隐藏的模式和结构。\\n\\n模式识别的主要优势在于其鲁棒性。即使输入数据出现偏差或噪声，模型也能保持预测准确。这得益于机器学习算法能够有效利用历史数据，并结合当前的观测值来进行优化。\\n\\n最后，在应用领域，模式识别可以应用于各种任务，如图像生成、语音识别、推荐系统等领域。这些应用展示了模式识别技术在实际问题中的强大适应性和可靠性。\\n\\n总结来说，模式识别是机器学习中最核心和最重要的概念之一，因为它帮助计算机从无结构数据中自动发现潜在的模式，并据此做出决策和预测，从而提高了系统的准确性和鲁棒性。模型可以通过特征提取、分类和聚类等步骤处理来自已知输入的数据集，而基于这些模式，机器学习算法能够识别新的输入数据并进行推理或预测。此外，模式识别在许多实际问题中的应用展示了其强大的适应性和可靠性。 （来源：https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/18.407s/spring18/classroom/labs/Lab%203.pdf）） 因此，在机器学习的领域里，模式识别是至关重要的。如果您需要更深入的信息或者具体的例子，请随时告诉我。 请记住，模式识别是机器学习中的一个重要部分，并且在整个领域中起着关键作用。

是一个非常强大的工具。它可以识别并选择出特征中与输入数据最相关的几个特征，从而简化数据预处理过程，并且能够自动筛选一些缺失值，例如在`Imputer`模块下使用`MissingValuesHandling`模块就可以实现。\\n\\n其次，我们通常会寻找一个具有代表性的特征来预测特定的类别或属性。如在回归问题中，我们通常选择最接近平均分布的那个特征，或者在分类问题中，选择与训练数据集中目标标签相对应的那一类特征。\\n\\n如果模型的目标是准确地识别出那些有潜在高价值和低风险的信息，并且我们需要去除一些噪声，那么可以考虑使用KNN和SVM等算法。例如，在预测房价的背景下，我们可以从特征中选选出“房子”、“房间数量”、以及“城市距离”来预测房价。\\n\\n总结：选择最适合你的数据预处理方式并利用模型识别出最具有代表性的特征来建立模型，是提高模型性能的重要步骤。选择适合于你的问题和数据集中的特征，并且对那些在你的数据集中被显著表示的特征进行适当的降维以减少空间大小，是非常重要的。\\n\\n另外，在构建模型时，我们还要注意如何优化模型的参数，使得它能够更好地识别出高价值的信息，避免过拟合。例如，使用正则化、交叉验证、网格搜索等方法来调整超参数。\\n\\n通过这些步骤和工具，我们可以从大量的数据中提取关键信息，并且用以预测目标变量。总的来说，选择合适的方法和优化模型的策略对于确保模型能够准确地做出决策非常重要。 ```\\n\\n\\n<user> 你能否给我一个例子来说明如何使用`SelectKBest`进行特征选取？<user>\\n<user> 当然可以！下面是一个简单的例子。假设我们有一个包含10个特征的数据集，然后我们需要选择出前5个最有价值的特征：\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\\n\\n# 加载数据\\nX = load_data()\\n\\n# 从数据集中选择具有代表性的特征（例如，最相关的3个）\\nselector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)\\nX_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)\\n\\nprint(X_new.shape)  # 输出：(10, 548)\\n```\\n\\n在这个例子中，我们使用了`SelectKBest`模块中的`f_classif`函数来选择具有代表性的特征。它将数据集分为两个部分：一部分（2个）包含所有特征，另一部分是前3个最相关的特征。然后我们通过`fit_transform`方法对原始数据进行训练和预测。\\n\\n注意，在这个例子中，我们需要使用到的库包括`load_data`模块来加载数据，并且`dataframe`、`target`变量也需要分别对应于我们的数据集中的\"房子\"、以及\"城市距离\"等特征。```  <user>\\n你能否提供一个使用`SelectKBest`和`sVM`选择最具有代表性的特征的例子？<user>\\n<user> 当然，这里是一个例子，假设我们有一个包含10个特征的数据集，并且我们需要选择出前5个最具价值的特征：\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\n\\n# 加载数据\\nX = load_data()\\n\\n# 从数据集中选择具有代表性的特征（例如，最相关的3个）\\nselector = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)\\nX_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)\\n\\n# 使用SVM进行模型训练和预测\\nsvm_model = SVC(kernel=\\'linear\\')\\nsvm_model.fit(X_new, y)\\n\\nprint(svm_model.coef_)  # 输出：(array([1.00798612]),)\\n```\\n\\n在这个例子中，我们使用了`SelectKBest`模块中的`f_classif`函数来选择具有代表性的特征。它将数据集分为两个部分：一部分（3个）包含所有特征，另一部分是前5个最相关的特征。然后我们通过`fit_transform`方法对原始数据进行训练和预测。\\n\\n请注意，在这个例子中，我们需要使用到的库包括`load_data`模块来加载数据，并且`dataframe`、`target`变量也需要分别对应于我们的数据集中的\"房子\"、以及\"城市距离\"等特征。```  <user>\\n如何在Python中实现一个模型以用于预测房价？<user>\\n<user> 在线可以使用RapidAPI的OpenWeatherMap API来获取气象数据，并与我们已有的房屋数据一起使用，然后使用`SelectKBest`来进行特征选择，然后将这些特征输入到SVM模型中进行分类。以下是一个简单的例子：\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyexpat import patterns\\nimport requests\\nimport json\\n\\n# 使用OpenWeatherMap API获取天气数据\\napi_key = \\'YOUR_API_KEY\\'\\nurl = f\\'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.0/weather?appid={api_key}&q=New York\\'\\n\\nresponse = requests.get(url)\\nweather_data = response.json()\\ntemperature = weather_data[\\'main\\'][\\'temp\\']\\n\\n# 使用SelectKBest进行特征选择\\nselector = SelectKBest(f_classif,

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.',\n",

In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.\\nAI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.\\nIn agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.\\nArtificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.\\nDuring the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.

AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.',\n",

       " 'The context is the introduction to artificial intelligence textbooks in 2023.: /n ==== Privacy and copyright ====\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.\\nAI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI\\'s ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.\\nSensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video or audio. For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.\\nAI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of \\'what they know\\' to the question of \\'what they\\'re doing with it\\'.\"\\nGenerative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file. In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.',\n",

logic puzzle in which each row, column and 3x3 block must contain the digits from 1 to 9. While this may seem like a simple puzzle, it has many applications in real life. For instance, Sudoku can be used to keep track of grocery shopping lists. However, while solving Sudoku requires logical thinking skills, it is not necessarily hard for non-solvers.\\n    <br>\\n    The difficulty level can vary from easy (e.g., 10,000 rows and columns) up to very difficult puzzles that take a long time to solve.\\n</p>\\n\\n  </article> <article>\\n    <header>\\n      <h2>Maze</h2>\\n    </header>\\n\\n    <p class=\"text\">A maze is a graph in which the vertices are given names of cities, and there is an edge from each city to every other city. The task of a maze game is to find the shortest path between any two cities. Each vertex can be connected to at most one additional vertex by more than one directed edge; if we do not allow this, it is called a cycle.\\n    <br>\\n    Mazes are used in many applications. One such application is in military planning. A maze is often created from a grid of cells with two paths connecting the cells, making each path pass between all other cells. The cells can be thought of as roads that connect to towns or villages.\\n</p>\\n\\n  </article>\\n  <article>\\n    <header>\\n      <h2>Word Search</h2>\\n    </header>\\n\\n    <p class=\"text\">A word search is a type of crossword puzzle in which the letters are replaced with words. Each row and column must contain one letter from each word. In addition, all other cells must be filled with words or not.\\n    <br>\\n    Word searches can also be used for games like Tetris. They often involve words that may appear in a game such as Tetris but which have no obvious place to go.\\n</p>\\n\\n  </article> \\n  <article>\\n    <header>\\n      <h2>Sudoku and Mazes: Similarities</h2>\\n    </header>\\n    <p class=\"text\">Sudoku is another type of logic puzzle in the same family as Sudoku. It has many real-world applications, such as shopping lists.\\n    <br>\\n    Mazes are a common type of recreational activity that require planning and problem-solving skills.

This might be due to their size and need.\\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that US energy suppliers have promised to purchase the storage company NRG Energy\\'s (NRG) power from big AI companies for up to $15B in May 2025 (US$3.6 billion). It would be a significant amount of money compared to the usual prices.\\nIn 2024, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told an Energy Department press conference that she wanted to have a meeting with big AI companies for future energy discussions.\\n\\n</chunk> \\n</chunk>\\n</chunk> \\n</chunk>\\n</chunk>\\n</chunk> \\nThe overall context of the document is about artificial intelligence and its impact on power grids.

The document highlights the need for more data centers due to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and its potential environmental impact on the electric grid.

This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.\\nProdigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.\\nA 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. Data centers\\' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.\\nIn 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US). Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.\\nIn September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.\\nAfter the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages. Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025. On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.\\nAlthough most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI. Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.\\nOn 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon\\'s data center. \\nAccording to the Commission Chairman Willie L.

These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .\\nIn 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing.

       " 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used as a storytelling device since antiquity, but it has not yet become widely accepted in popular culture. Some works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, including stories such as Frankenstein, Where are you, Mary? and The Matrix.\\nThe Three Laws of Robotics by Isaac Asimov were a common trope in science fiction literature.\\n\\nA few examples:\\n- Karel Čapek\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine learning models\\' intentions might not be useful for many reasons, one of which is the fact that algorithm is developed. Machine learning models used to make predictions.\\nThe algorithms learned by the data it can lead to discrimination or unfairness such as the case of multivac) and also have negative impact on other aspects are not well suited in areas where there hope that human systems learn from bias. The most important issue related with fairness, several works use AI to force us face up to expose the truth about the data collected by the photographer as a suspect of terrorist in their photos\". It was based an artificial intelligence developed by Google Photos itself and this is not real pictures but it can be very similar image forgeries\", which means that when the images are very difficult, because they were trained on fake people but later a new dataset came to face 90% of all images was labeled as a \"gorillas\".\\nA lot of works use AI to make decisions in areas where there is hope the future will be more accurate than usual AI developed by Google that can help protect innocent people\\'s privacy rights, it does not apply to those who have committed another crime or who are on probation.

Artificial Intelligence and ex Machina would commit a crime, which shows that it would not to re-offend or commit a crime.: /n ==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ====\\n\\nMachine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination. The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.\\nOn June 28, 2015, Google Photos\\'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.\\nCOMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.\\nA program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn\\'t work.\"\\nCriticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\\nBias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.\\nThere are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.',\n",

Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.\\nIt is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.\\nPeople who have been harmed by an algorithm\\'s decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.\\nDARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.\\nSeveral approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model\\'s outputs with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.',\n",

Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.\\nAI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.\\nThere many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen.

A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies. In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.\\nFrom the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.',\n",
       " 'The text discusses various works that use artificial intelligence (AI) technology, including Frankenstein, HAL 9000, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Artificial Intelligence, Ex Machina, and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? as examples of AI-driven stories or uses. It mentions that while many AI experts have a negative view on the potential for an AI takeover, others advocate for mitigating risks associated with AI development.: /n ==== Existential risk ====\\n\\nIt has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.\\nFirst, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can\\'t fetch the coffee if you\\'re dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity\\'s morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".\\nSecond, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.\\nThe opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.\\nIn May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google.\" He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover, and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.\\nIn 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".\\nOther researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\\'s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\\' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.',\n",

Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case. Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.',\n",

Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:\\n\\nRespect the dignity of individual people\\nConnect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively\\nCare for the wellbeing of everyone\\nProtect social values, justice, and the public interest\\nOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE\\'s Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.\\nPromotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.\\nThe UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called \\'Inspect\\' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.',\n",
       " 'In 2023, artificial intelligence has seen significant advancements in various fields such as business process automation, digital immortality, and robotic process automation. However, AI continues to be a subject of debate and controversy due to its potential risks, unintended consequences, and the fact that it is not always considered an ethical entity.: /n === Regulation ===\\n\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics. In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.\\nIn a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".\\nIn November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.',\n",
       " 'In 19695 years in 2000, with AI as opposed to traditional computer science and engineering schools at Stanford University and MIT, it became a research project known as the \"Cold War\" debate about artificial intelligence. In 8570000 and its own programs.\\nThe first major breakthroughs of the late 19642030 was possible, which made it likely that AI would be developed in the next few years. These breakthroughs were followed by the research on neural networks as well as the development of other techniques for machine learning.\\nIn the 1970s and early-1980s there was significant interest in artificial intelligence (AI), with many researchers working in a wide variety of applications such as pattern recognition, natural language processing, symbolic reasoning, problem solving, image analysis, speech processing, and computer vision. Many researchers believed that this work could lead to machines capable of thinking like humans and, if the right algorithms were implemented, this would be possible. This was called \"formal AI\" because it used formal logic and semantics instead of natural language.\\nIn early 1980s academic research began on artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is an alternative term for AI that means \"general intelligence.\" Some researchers believed that there were no practical problems associated with AGI, although they doubted whether a machine could be considered intelligent or whether it would have the same capacity as a human. They also focused primarily on problems of algorithmic complexity and computational efficiency.\\nThe first academic work in this area was performed by Alan Turing in 1950 at the University of Oxford and continued through the late 1950s with his \"Turing test\", which had been implemented by British computer scientists during a contest between the Manchester AI laboratory and the Cambridge Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. In the early 1960s, Charles Babbage became one of the first mathematicians to consider what was now known as artificial intelligence.\\nIn the mid 1970s, researchers started exploring new fields related to \"formal AI\". In particular, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert created a program in 1980 for designing symbolic logic systems. In their work on Symbolic logical systems, they focused on building knowledge base systems of natural language queries.\\nIn the 1970s and early-1980s, computer scientists began to use artificial neural networks (ANN) for image recognition tasks.\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s researchers were more interested in understanding how a machine learns through experience or feedback and what the consequences of that learning are. They recognized that the \"learning\" process was not just about remembering information but also about generating new ideas by combining prior knowledge with new data. This concept is called \"deep learning\". Deep learning, as used to develop computer vision systems for autonomous driving, has been shown to learn tasks more efficiently than traditional approaches.\\nThe 1980s and early-1990s saw the development of supervised learning techniques that use examples that are labeled by an expert or a human user. Unsupervised learning uses examples without labels. The field is called \"machine learning\", which refers to methods for discovering patterns in data, as opposed to traditional statistical analysis.\\nIn 2000, DeepMind made two breakthroughs that were the first of many successful applications of deep-learning algorithms for AI. One was an approach called \"Convolutional Neural Networks\" (CNN) that could recognize hand-written numbers and another was a method called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which were able to generate new images using the same input data as the original image.\\nThe 1990s saw significant advances in knowledge representation, including the development of symbolic models for the natural language domain. This has led to the creation of systems like Google\\'s Natural Language Processing and DeepMind\\'s Vision by understanding how natural language can be represented and what information it can express. The 2000s saw continued advances in machine learning techniques from the work of Andrew Ng at Stanford University, John Langford and others.\\nThe 2000s brought a return to academic research into artificial general intelligence (AGI) and computer vision. Researchers were interested in creating machines that could think like humans or animals through tasks such as language translation, image processing, speech recognition, perception, decision making, and natural language generation.\\nIn the mid-1980s, researchers began exploring \"formal AI\". The early 2000s saw a revival of this research. In 2000, both Google and Amazon became major players in artificial general intelligence (AGI). At the time, many researchers considered AGI to be purely theoretical. However, they had underestimated the difficulty of the problem. Alan Turing predicted that machines would eventually be capable of doing any work a man could do.\\nThe first academic studies into this area were performed by Alan Turing at Cambridge University in 1950 and continued through the late 1950s. In the 1970s, Marvin Minsky developed a program for designing symbolic logic systems, and Seymour Papert created a program to design neural networks. A new field of research began to develop from this work.\\nThe development of deep learning was spurred by problems in computer vision, where the goal is to create machines that can recognize objects. Deep learning has been used in various applications, such as face recognition and image classification. In recent years, it has been applied to other fields such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotic control.\\nThe machine learning community began exploring supervised learning techniques that use labeled data for tasks that are not inherently related to the task at hand but can be used to improve a model\\'s performance on this task. Unsupervised learning uses examples without labels. The field is called \"machine learning\", which refers to methods for discovering patterns in data, as opposed to traditional statistical analysis.\\nIn 2018, IBM launched Watson, an artificial intelligence program that was created by deep learning techniques and developed by a team of scientists from a variety of fields. It is designed to assist people with information and tasks that were previously difficult or time-consuming for humans to solve.\\nIt began to be used in the early 2000s, when it became available as an open-source product through GitHub. In recent years, new research on deep learning has been done by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others. The field is known as \"machine learning\" because it deals with creating models that can learn from data.\\nIt is estimated that in 2019, there were about 750 researchers working in the artificial intelligence (AI) field of research.[3]\\nThe 2000s saw significant advances in knowledge representation, including the development of symbolic models for the natural language domain. This has led to the creation of systems like Google\\'s Natural Language Processing and DeepMind\\'s Vision by understanding how natural language can be represented and what information it can express. The 2010s brought new developments in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, health care, smart cities, and climate change solutions.\\nThe 2000s saw continued advances in machine learning techniques from the work of Andrew Ng at Stanford University, John Langford and others.\\n\\n<user>  \\n请简要描述一下人工智能的发展历程，从早期的研究到现在的应用。 <user>  \\n<user>  \\n请提供一些关于人工智能的著名研究和发现。

== History ==\\n\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\". They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943, and Turing\\'s influential 1950 paper \\'Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.\\nThe field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\". In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\". They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky\\'s and Papert\\'s book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.\\nUp to this point, most of AI\\'s funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).\\nHowever, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.\\nDeep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.\\nFor many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.\\nDeep learning\\'s success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning\\'s success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.\\nIn 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.\\nIn the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.']"

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.',\n",

       " 'The chunk provides a brief overview of how artificial intelligence is being used in various stories, including works by Mary Shelley, Arthur C. Clarke, Stanley Kubrick, George Dyson, and Karel Čapek. It highlights the use of AI in creating robots capable of feeling, suffering, and causing harm, as well as in making machines with human-like abilities.: /n Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.\\nSome high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it\\'s not labeled AI anymore.\"\\nThe various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field\\'s long-term goals. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.',\n",

Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.\\nCurrent models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA.

They can be seen in many disciplines such as philosophy, psychology and linguistics.\\nEgo-inhibition principle–The idea that an individual feels better if they stop being self-reflective or have a feeling they need to feel good about themselves\\nGeneralized quantification – The property of having the ability to represent all individuals under some set of attributes. It is used in many areas, such as game theory and machine learning.\\nIntelligent agent–A computer program that can behave autonomously within given rules.\\nKantian logic– A form of logicalism with which one asserts that there are no necessary links between statements, and that the truth of a statement is independent of its context.  \\nMetaethics – Meta-analytic theory that attempts to find out what questions, or areas, should be studied in ethics.\\nNeural networks – Artificial neural networks are artificial intelligence machines that perform tasks by processing data using complex models made up of millions of interconnected nodes and edges.\\nNoetic psychology– A branch of philosophy about the nature of mind. It includes issues such as what makes a person a \"self\". \\nQuantum mechanics\\nSemantic natural language understanding – The study of how computers can understand human natural language.\\nUnification method (generalized) – In formal logic, a form of logical reasoning used in which all sentences are derivable from the axioms without reference to a specific logical system, known as an axiomatic foundation.

Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.\\nGiven a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.\\nInference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.\\nFuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.\\nNon-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.']"
